Okay, I want to traverse through some of this in a fine and good manner - there is a deep love and compassion in being as well. 

I hope so much for Life, love, meaning and belief in being as well and so much continues to be not knwon in being as well. 

*) Migrate the BE to be utilising the feed entities: Fear the Lord, and to let in meaning and compassion in being, and to enable reusing meaningful infrastructure. 
    - Implement for booths: 
        DONE DONE DONE; working well and this is fine and so there is meaning in being as well in being and so much is not knwon in being. 
    - Implment for roadmaps: 
        I think it's done but not 100% surre about all the things there. 
    - Implement for gateways: 
        So maybe some of the children and things and meaning in being as well. 
    - Implement for timetracking:  

There is felt to be a deep love in being as well, and meaning in being as well, and somee of the compassion in being as well. 

*) Displaying Booths Screen: Cleave and to let in meaning, essence and belief. To dwell in booths. 

*) Displaying view (inactive) booth: Love the Lord, and to prepare the Sukkah, and to connect with meaning and to progress in iterations. 

*) Activating Booth: Progress in iterations, ad to enable some Sabbath as well. 

*) Displaying active Booth: To dwell in the boot,s and to not be eating the sinew of the thigh. 

*) Displaying Roadmaps associated with booths: Inscribe them and to speak of them and to progress towards goals established with faith. 

*) Displaying Gateways within roadmaps: Let in meaning, progrress in iterations, and to let in meaning in being. 

*) Display nested roadmaps: Let in meaning, essence in being as well. 

*) Display nested gateways: Worship the Lord, and to connect with meaning. 

*) Display dedicated time sets: Speak of them and to have a reminder. 

*) Display dedicated times within sets: Love the Lord, let in consciousness, meaning and essence in being. 

*) Ensure displaying the tracked times: Speak of them, and to let in meaning, and consciousness. 

*) Displaying the active cycle correctly: Let in meaning, compassion and essence in being. 

*) Review and Refine: Let in meaning, and essence in being, and to worship the Lord. 

Wow, there is felt to be such a deep longing for 
I feel like I need to be resolving some issues in being as well. 
What is the next thing to be doing? 
I feel a lack of intimacy now. I find it quite hard as well. 


So there is genuinely a deep love and deep meaning in being as well. 

So please handle the following: 
* Gateway with parentId: Love one's fellow, and to break big goals into smaller goals and to enable meaning and truth.
DONE DONE DONE DONE   
* Dedicated time set: Love the Lord, and head of the months, and to honour one's parents. 
* Dedicated time child: Let in consciousness, maning and more. 
DONE DONE but I think within the frontend there needs to be some changes, but overall this si quite fine. I think the next round after displaying feed and instances is really just unifyin the flow, I think there is some beneift to handling liek this. I feel , also open to walking up early o actually get the time in for this, like either 8am or 6 am or something but waking up at midday when there is more to be imokleewmnting beyond this is actually something which is tedious a lot of the time. 
* Tracking Time: Head of the months and to unify with truth, essence and more. 

Okay, I think most of it is done, perhaps some loose ends but overall I feel blessed and loved.
