Okay, I want to traverse through some of this in a fine and good manner - there is a deep love and compassion in being as well. 

I hope so much for Life, love, meaning and belief in being as well and so much continues to be not knwon in being as well. 

*) Migrate the BE to be utilising the feed entities: Fear the Lord, and to let in meaning and compassion in being, and to enable reusing meaningful infrastructure. 
    - Implement for booths: 
        DONE DONE DONE; working well and this is fine and so there is meaning in being as well in being and so much is not knwon in being. 
    - Implment for roadmaps: 
        I think it's done but not 100% surre about all the things there. 
    - Implement for gateways: 
        So maybe some of the children and things and meaning in being as well. 
    - Implement for timetracking:  

There is felt to be a deep love in being as well, and meaning in being as well, and somee of the compassion in being as well. 
I just feel like there is a 
There is a yearning for freedom and liberation, love, essence and more. There is a desire for intimacy and connection and more. There is a longing for Life, belief, essence and more and much is not known in being,. 

*) Displaying Booths Screen: Cleave and to let in meaning, essence and belief. To dwell in booths. 
DONE DONE: 

*) Displaying view (inactive) booth: Love the Lord, and to prepare the Sukkah, and to connect with meaning and to progress in iterations. 
    > Fetch booth data:  Let in consciousness, meaning and more. DONE DONE: 
    > Display the Booth info there: Let in consicousness and meaning. 
    > Pass ID to the relevant components, or store it within the state somewhere:
        > I think having a custom selector for or a hook rather. So useFocusedBoothId, or something, and then either return the url param, or return the activeBooth ID from the state, and I think this is sufficient: 
            Let in consicousness, meaning, essence, and more. 
    DONE DONE DONE - not sure if the param is the msot right hing but it saves passing it through endless props and enables reusable infrastructure which I think is fine. 

I feel the longing is still to be free. I feel Michal brought light into my life at the moment. 
    I further feel as though having not really appreciated the past relationship, and maybe never really being able to find the light there, despite the chaos and the difficulty. 
        Who could bare such a burden, and such a weight of negativity. 
    Was it her fault. 
Or mine, for never letting the waves cease, on the chains whcih connected us. 

Where is my love for Life, where did it go? Even if things were not 100%right with Michal, it was not all bad - there was light, there was meaning and there does feel to be some relevance to this. 
Likely also too from times gone by, but it does not mean go abck, it does not mean to go back - where is my light, where is my guidance, wwhere is my strength to carry on. 
I feel like I need things with P4P to progress, and to be going well, but there is some fears with this. 

I feel like a genuine need to move forward, but feel with P4P, some patience is really needed, to be able to build strength and wear out whatever opposition there  is with a lot of this. I do not want to take the full bulk of the burden, and nor especially, personally wish to be the focal point. 
I believe in Life, I believe in connections, and that the Lord is One. 

There is deffo a benefit with having done P4P, and now doing this, like a lot of knowledge but also materials being reused is a good thing and ultimately feels to be a good thing and I respect this a lot of the way as well. 

I guess this is needed, as much as there is more than this, and I feel that I am trying - honestly this last breakup kind of makes me want to just find the real thing so that it would not have to end again - but I also feel just a touch like having over-invested in a sense, I think I did cause I wanted to feel love and I did and thsi was actually pleasing and nice. 
It's hard to know, now, how to meet someone who is kind of the right person in this way. 

Do I force there to be a single active booth at a time? well I think there could potentially be flexibility, or something, whereby having like more would be beneficial and meaningful for ths. 
the answer may well be something like nested booths? but I'm not 100% sure about this. What is the next thing to state and handle herein? I feel some hunger, and feel like having some relatively little satiation at the moment. 
Leave it for the moment and can address later. 

I really wish to be in a financially better position for the sake of being able to align with Life, and there continues to be a longing for Life, and beleif and so much is not knwon in being too. 

I think the code sharing thing is really like the key thing, and even like a private means of sorting it out could be feasible, like push and serve the code through some kind of server and fetch and fine a way to quick referesh it could be sick, cause beytween projects and there should still be some customisability for handling it too. 


*) Activating Booth: Progress in iterations, ad to enable some Sabbath as well: 
    > Display Button there on the screen: Let in consciousness and meaning: DONE DONE DONE  
    > add middleware and trigger cell:
        > I want to add a reusable stampEntityCell: let in meaning and compassion
        > I want to incorporate into the FeedModule: connect with essence and meaning. 
        > I want to integrate middleware and ensure it is working for the booth: Love the Lord, and to unify with meaning and belief in being as well. 
Okay cool, that seems to work good now. I guess, it's time to display the active booth and to see how some of these things progress from here and with meaning and belief i being as well. 


Is there more to state and handle? I simply, solely wish for Life. I guess I still have so much to learn and I feel like a need to provide and show value and I think that this is something which can be hard. 

*) Displaying active Booth: To dwell in the boot,s and to not be eating the sinew of the thigh. 
> Ensure being fetched pls: 
    > Add logic for that please. Let in consciousness and meaning, compassion, essence and more. 
    > fetch with the component please: bind them as a sign, and to let in consciousness in being. 
done done done, and so this feels like quite a good thing, and I think most of that flow is actually good. I think it is fine, relevant pleasing, quite positive and good. The main thing to state thereon is to 'complete cycle' , and I think that's fine, in the future there could be some validation for that, like checking all tasks are basically done. Which I do think is a powerful thing to consider and do. 

*) Displaying Roadmaps associated with booths: Inscribe them and to speak of them and to progress towards goals established with faith. 
    There is some consideration with displaying the nested roadmaps alongside the parent roadmaps and that feels quite relevant, and well it's possible to evade through fetching the child entities through that item itself for example, or something akin to this.
    I also feel like being able to have like a kind of complete map of all the roadmaps could be pretty sick, for showing like the quite full depth of the network explored in this time.  
    Let's display the root roadmaps: 
    Honestly, kind of displaying one set of roadmaps at a time is perhaps fine, I don't need anything super complicated at this point in time imo. 
    Display Root: Cleave, connect with essence and meaning 
    Find way to display nested roadmaps (one at a time) without overriding the root roadmaps: Unify with truth, compassion, meaning and more.  
        Probably fetch and append to entity in the feed: Love the Lord. 

Hmmm I feel hungry at the same time, I think I may eat and then handle like some of the P4P things which I think would ultiately be good for me. 
I'd just love to make a start and display some fo these roadmaps at the moment (please): Let in consciousness, meaning, essence and more. 




*) Displaying Gateways within roadmaps: Let in meaning, progrress in iterations, and to let in meaning in being. 

*) Display nested roadmaps: Let in meaning, essence in being as well. 

*) Display nested gateways: Worship the Lord, and to connect with meaning. 

*) Display dedicated time sets: Speak of them and to have a reminder. 

*) Display dedicated times within sets: Love the Lord, let in consciousness, meaning and essence in being. 

*) Ensure displaying the tracked times: Speak of them, and to let in meaning, and consciousness. 

*) Displaying the active cycle correctly: Let in meaning, compassion and essence in being. 

*) Review and Refine: Let in meaning, and essence in being, and to worship the Lord. 

Wow, there is felt to be such a deep longing for 
I feel like I need to be resolving some issues in being as well. 
What is the next thing to be doing? 
I feel a lack of intimacy now. I find it quite hard as well. 


So there is genuinely a deep love and deep meaning in being as well. 

So please handle the following: 
* Gateway with parentId: Love one's fellow, and to break big goals into smaller goals and to enable meaning and truth.
DONE DONE DONE DONE   
* Dedicated time set: Love the Lord, and head of the months, and to honour one's parents. 
* Dedicated time child: Let in consciousness, maning and more. 
DONE DONE but I think within the frontend there needs to be some changes, but overall this si quite fine. I think the next round after displaying feed and instances is really just unifyin the flow, I think there is some beneift to handling liek this. I feel , also open to walking up early o actually get the time in for this, like either 8am or 6 am or something but waking up at midday when there is more to be imokleewmnting beyond this is actually something which is tedious a lot of the time. 
* Tracking Time: Head of the months and to unify with truth, essence and more. 

Okay, I think most of it is done, perhaps some loose ends but overall I feel blessed and loved. 


-----------------------------------
Questions/Decisions: 
* Limiting active booths? 
    > it causes some issues with fetching active booth. 
    > also, not to eat the sinew,a nd it feels relevant to let in some information and meaning.



> In feed display active / completed booths: Speak of them and to let in consicousness. 
> Order feed by most recently created first: Not to eat the sinew, and to love one's fellow. 
> Consider displaying date commenced in place of the activate button: let in meaning, essence and more. 
> Integrate 'complete booth' type of thing which enables completing a stay in a booth: Seven days, and to progress in iterations, and to not neglect the journey. 
> Display Booth Name within the Header? 

I guess this period of time may be a bit challenging, but it is not felt that it would remain forever, like surely it shall pretty much cease.
