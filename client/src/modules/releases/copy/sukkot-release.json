            "description": "Organise your responsibilities into recurring cycles, helping you return, reflect and grow. Each cycle naturally includes a break/sabbatical to help you balance work and play. \n\n\n The Etrog (fruit of the hadar tree), typically relates to the heart and fragrance, it's a symbol of wholeness and Life's fleeting transicence. This can correlate to the cycle's flowing/transeit rhythm and it's complete, cyclical, nature."

            "name": "Time Management",
            "description": "Structure your hours and days, creating space for what matters most. Being in command of one's time is a key way to living freely and purposefully. \n\n\n The hadas (myrtle), associated with the eyes, reflects vision and clarity. In the same way, mindful timekeeping can help us to plan and move forward in alignment with one's vision, intention and unity of being."
        }
    ],
    "narrative": "Yes! Of course this is incomplete, and in the process of being built. That's the whole point. Because, so are you. \n\n The festival of sukkot commemorates dwelling in booths, temporary shelters, whilst in the desert leaving Egypt. The instruction to dwell in booths each year is a reminder that the journey of liberation continues into the transient present. The pursuit for liberating personal growth is real, sacred and inherently ours. \n\n This release offers tools to help you build, dismantle, and rebuild structures that support your growth and creativity.",
    "intentionalText": "I am happy to share this space with you, please explore and experience it with an open mind noting that this space and the basic tools are still in a relatively early stage",
